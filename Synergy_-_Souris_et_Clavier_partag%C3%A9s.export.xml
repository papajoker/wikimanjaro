      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5993">==Synergy - Mouse &amp; k/board Sharing Across Multiple OS's==




&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
==Introduction==

Synergy is a brilliant piece of software that doesn't require much effort to get going, Though after that it required me some more time to get it to function just how I want it to = faultless autostart.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
==So What Does Synergy Do?== 

I can now use my favourite keyboard &amp; mouse to operate two computers (synergy will do plenty more computers if you have them) one at a time of course... 

The two machines are set up to load synergy when they boot, &amp; it doesn't matter what order the server or the client is booted in, when they are both up, synergy automatically does its stuff, using next to no system resources.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
==The Three B's - BS, Blurb &amp; Bug:==

Years ago I paid a lot of money for a really good quality four machine handling KVM switch box. It worked very well via keyboard command until the day it failed. :(  In those days when I was fixing computers, that KVM was far superior to synergy because it was hardware that was system independent &amp; worked on anything that had a working BIOS.

For my needs today, the synergy system shits all over a KVM, though there are varying limitations which are dictated by the display manager / OS you are using. 

Running Openbox, I can't make use of synergy until OB has loaded. On some Linux display managers you can use it before hand &amp; I'm sure that OS/X &amp; the various Windows all have their strengths &amp; weaknesses in this regard. In the end this doesn't really matter to me as I spend very little time outside of OB anyway. So for my current computer usage synergy is all but gob smacking perfect. 

All but? Yes, just one tiny bug that effects a few of us. For some users when moving the mouse from one computer screen to another you get a one or (far more rare) a two second black screen. 

I got the one second one when moving from the client to the server. For most this is fixed by issuing the command  '''xset -dpms'''. This works for me so I issue it in ''~/.xinitrc'' so the problem never appears. 

This problem has been around for about a year, &amp; someone has written a patch for it inside of the last month, so I'll hang back &amp; wait for the next release which I expect to have killed this bug, in the mean time I no longer know it exists.

I'm sure that this bug no longer exists, don't be put off by it.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
==The Synergys Server:==


&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===Installation:===

Rather than me duplicating it, the Archwiki has a great page on [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Synergy/ Synergy installation].

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===Configuration:===

My '''/etc/hosts''' file follows which should speak for itself:


 192.168.1.3             rightpc.localdomain  rightpc         ## the HP server
 192.168.1.6             leftpc.localdomain      leftpc          ## the iMac client

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===Synergy.conf===

Here is a great start (a complete solution in my case) for a very smoothly running pair of machines (easily edited for more though), via one mouse &amp; keyboard being connected to the synergys server - this '''synergy.conf''' is the server configuration file which does the job faultlessly for me:



 #synergy.conf
 
 section: screens
 	leftpc:
 		halfDuplexCapsLock = false
 		halfDuplexNumLock = false
 		halfDuplexScrollLock = false
 		xtestIsXineramaUnaware = false
 		switchCorners = none +top-left +top-right  +bottom-left +bottom-right 
 		switchCornerSize = 0
 	rightpc:
 		halfDuplexCapsLock = false
 		halfDuplexNumLock = false
 		halfDuplexScrollLock = false
 		xtestIsXineramaUnaware = false
 		switchCorners = none +top-left +top-right +bottom-left +bottom-right 
 		switchCornerSize = 0
 end
 
 section: aliases
 leftpc:
 192.168.1.6
 rightpc:
 192.168.1.3
 end
 
 section: links
 	leftpc:
 		right = rightpc
 	rightpc:
 		left = leftpc
 end
 
 section: options
 	heartbeat = 1000
 	relativeMouseMoves = false
 	screenSaverSync = false
 	win32KeepForeground = false
 	switchCorners = none +top-left +top-right  +bottom-left +bottom-right 
 	switchCornerSize = 4
 end
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
This '''synergyc.conf''' file suits my uses perfectly, I found it on the Arch wiki, &amp; it needed no functional modification. I put it in /home/handy as a &lt;.dot&gt; file i.e. ~/.synergy.conf .

OK, that is the server taken care of above, now its time for;-

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

==The Synergy Client(s):==

Install synergy.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===Client /etc/hosts:===

Edit the '''/etc/hosts''' file, mine is below for those that do need to reference, &amp; if you do make sure you compare it with the server side one posted earlier on this page:

 192.168.1.6     leftpc.localdomain               leftpc          ## the iMac client
 192.168.1.3     rightpc.localdomain             rightpc         ## the HP server [/code]


&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
====Synergy shares the clipboard too!!!====

''(By the way, due to synergy I could just use the keyboard shortcuts to copy the above from the Terminal on the client &amp; then move my mouse over to the server where I'm typing this &amp; then use the keyboard to paste it! '''Synergy shares the clipboard too!!!''' Which is brilliant.)''


&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===~/.xinitrc===

Add the following to the '''~/.xinitrc''' file (guess how I copied it?):

 synergyc -d ERROR rightpc

No need for the xset -dpms bug fix on this machine thankfully (It extremely likely that this bug is now long dead).

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
==Conclusion:==

The server is where the hardest work is, beyond that it comes down to getting your auto-start sorted so that it just works no matter which machine(s) come on in what order. For me the above works in that regard perfectly, (once Openbox has loaded).

I hope the above makes the info that is already on the net just a little easier to optimise for your usage.

I'm SO happy to at last not be swapping the ***king keyboards &amp; mouses all the time, it drives me ***king nuts.

In the end this doesn't really matter to me as I spend very little time outside of OB anyway. So for my current computer usage synergy is all but gob smacking perfect. 

All but? Yes, just one tiny bug that effects a few of us. For some users when moving the mouse from one computer screen to another you get a one or (far more rare) a two second black screen. 

I got the one second one when moving from the client to the server. For most this is fixed by issuing the command  '''xset -dpms'''. This works for me so I issue it in ''~/.xinitrc'' so the problem never appears. 

This problem has been around for about a year, &amp; someone has written a patch for it inside of the last month, so I'll hang back &amp; wait for the next release which I expect to have killed this bug, in the mean time I no longer know it exists.

I'm sure that this bug no longer exists, don't be put off by it.

==The Synergys Server:==


&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===Installation:===

Rather than me duplicating it, the Archwiki has a great page on [https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Synergy/ Synergy installation].

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===Configuration:===

My '''/etc/hosts''' file follows which should speak for itself:


 192.168.1.3             rightpc.localdomain  rightpc         ## the HP server
 192.168.1.6             leftpc.localdomain      leftpc          ## the iMac client

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===Synergy.conf===

Here is a great start (a complete solution in my case) for a very smoothly running pair of machines (easily edited for more though), via one mouse &amp; keyboard being connected to the synergys server - this '''synergy.conf''' is the server configuration file which does the job faultlessly for me:



 #synergy.conf
 
 section: screens
 	leftpc:
 		halfDuplexCapsLock = false
 		halfDuplexNumLock = false
 		halfDuplexScrollLock = false
 		xtestIsXineramaUnaware = false
 		switchCorners = none +top-left +top-right  +bottom-left +bottom-right 
 		switchCornerSize = 0
 	rightpc:
 		halfDuplexCapsLock = false
 		halfDuplexNumLock = false
 		halfDuplexScrollLock = false
 		xtestIsXineramaUnaware = false
 		switchCorners = none +top-left +top-right +bottom-left +bottom-right 
 		switchCornerSize = 0
 end
 
 section: aliases
 leftpc:
 192.168.1.6
 rightpc:
 192.168.1.3
 end
 
 section: links
 	leftpc:
 		right = rightpc
 	rightpc:
 		left = leftpc
 end
 
 section: options
 	heartbeat = 1000
 	relativeMouseMoves = false
 	screenSaverSync = false
 	win32KeepForeground = false
 	switchCorners = none +top-left +top-right  +bottom-left +bottom-right 
 	switchCornerSize = 4
 end
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
This '''synergyc.conf''' file suits my uses perfectly, I found it on the Arch wiki, &amp; it needed no functional modification. I put it in /home/handy as a &lt;.dot&gt; file i.e. ~/.synergy.conf .

OK, that is the server taken care of above, now its time for;-

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

==The Synergy Client(s):==

Install synergy.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===Client /etc/hosts:===

Edit the '''/etc/hosts''' file, mine is below for those that do need to reference, &amp; if you do make sure you compare it with the server side one posted earlier on this page:

 192.168.1.6     leftpc.localdomain               leftpc          ## the iMac client
 192.168.1.3     rightpc.localdomain             rightpc         ## the HP server [/code]


&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
====Synergy shares the clipboard too!!!====

''(By the way, due to synergy I could just use the keyboard shortcuts to copy the above from the Terminal on the client &amp; then move my mouse over to the server where I'm typing this &amp; then use the keyboard to paste it! '''Synergy shares the clipboard too!!!''' Which is brilliant.)''


&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
===~/.xinitrc===

Add the following to the '''~/.xinitrc''' file (guess how I copied it?):

 synergyc -d ERROR rightpc

No need for the xset -dpms bug fix on this machine thankfully (It extremely likely that this bug is now long dead).

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
==Conclusion:==

The server is where the hardest work is, beyond that it comes down to getting your auto-start sorted so that it just works no matter which machine(s) come on in what order. For me the above works in that regard perfectly, (once Openbox has loaded).

I hope the above makes the info that is already on the net just a little easier to optimise for your usage.

I'm SO happy to at last not be swapping the ***king keyboards &amp; mouses all the time, it drives me ***king nuts.

==Synergy - Partage de la souris et du clavier entre plusieurs systèmes d'exploitation==




&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;


==Introduction==

Synergy  est un logiciel brillant, facile à mettre en oeuvre, bien qu'il m'ait demandé un peu de temps pour j'arrive à lui faire faire exactement ce que je voulais : un démarrage automatique irréprochable. 
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

==So What Does Synergy Do?== 

I can now use my favourite keyboard &amp; mouse to operate two computers (synergy will do plenty more computers if you have them) one at a time of course... 

The two machines are set up to load synergy when they boot, &amp; it doesn't matter what order the server or the client is booted in, when they are both up, synergy automatically does its stuff, using next to no system resources.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;
==The Three B's - BS, Blurb &amp; Bug:==

Years ago I paid a lot of money for a really good quality four machine handling KVM switch box. It worked very well via keyboard command until the day it failed. :(  In those days when I was fixing computers, that KVM was far superior to synergy because it was hardware that was system independent &amp; worked on anything that had a working BIOS.

For my needs today, the synergy system shits all over a KVM, though there are varying limitations which are dictated by the display manager / OS you are using. 

Running Openbox, I can't make use of synergy until OB has loaded. On some Linux display managers you can use it before hand &amp; I'm sure that OS/X &amp; the various Windows all have their strengths &amp; weaknesses in this regard. In the end this doesn't really matter to me as I spend very little time outside of OB anyway. So for my current computer usage synergy is all but gob smacking perfect. 

All but? Yes, just one tiny bug that effects a few of us. For some users when moving the mouse from one computer screen to another you get a one or (far more rare) a two second black screen. 

I got the one second one when moving from the client to the server. For most this is fixed by issuing the command  '''xset -dpms'''. This works for me so I issue it in ''~/.xinitrc'' so the problem never appears. 

This problem has been around for about a year, &amp; someone has written a patch for it inside of the last month, so I'll hang back &amp; wait for the next release which I expect to have killed this bug, in the mean time I no longer know it exists.

I'm sure that this bug no longer exists, don't be put off by it.
